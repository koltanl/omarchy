# Git Management for Omarchy Repository

## Repository Overview
This is the **Omarchy** repository - your hot personal development stash. This is a fast-moving, experimental codebase where rapid iteration and immediate commits are encouraged.

## Git Configuration

### Remote Configuration
- **Remote URL**: `git@github-personal.com:koltanl/omarchy.git`
- **Account**: koltanl (personal GitHub account)
- **SSH Key**: Uses `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` via `github-personal.com` host alias
- **Branch Strategy**: Direct to `main` branch (no feature branches)

### User Configuration
```
user.name=Coltin Leekley
user.email=coltinleekley@gmail.com
```

## Development Workflow

### Core Philosophy
**This is your personal hot stash - commit early, commit often, push to main immediately.**

### Commit Strategy
1. **Always comment your commits** - Even if it's just a quick "WIP" or "testing X feature"
2. **Push to main directly** - No feature branches, no pull requests
3. **Commit frequency**: Make commits whenever you have a working state, even if incomplete
4. **Commit messages**: Be descriptive but don't overthink it:
   - `"Add basic auth system"`
   - `"Fix login bug"`
   - `"WIP: implementing dashboard"`
   - `"Test new API endpoint"`

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Make your changes
# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"

# Push immediately to main
git push origin main
```

## Branch Management

### Primary Branch
- **`main`** - The only branch you need
- All development happens directly on main
- No feature branches, no staging, no PRs
- This is your personal sandbox - use it freely

### Branch Commands
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Switch to main (if needed)
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

## SSH Configuration

### Current Setup
The repository uses SSH with a custom host alias:
- **Host**: `github-personal.com` (aliased to `github.com`)
- **Key**: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- **User**: `git`

### SSH Config (from ~/.ssh/config)
```
Host github-personal.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

## Common Commands

### Essential Git Operations
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Add specific files
git add filename.txt

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

### Repository Information
```bash
# Check remote configuration
git remote -v

# Check current branch
git branch

# Check git configuration
git config --list
```

## Best Practices for This Repository

### Do's ✅
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Push to main immediately after commits
- Use meaningful commit messages (even if brief)
- Test changes before committing (when possible)
- Keep the repository in a working state
- Use `git status` to check what's changed

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't create feature branches (unless experimenting)
- Don't leave uncommitted work for days
- Don't commit without messages
- Don't worry about "perfect" commit history
- Don't use `--force` unless absolutely necessary

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **SSH Key Issues**: Verify `ssh -T git@github-personal.com` works
2. **Remote URL Issues**: Check with `git remote -v`
3. **Merge Conflicts**: Usually just `git pull origin main` resolves them
4. **Wrong Account**: Ensure you're using `github-personal.com` not `github.com`

### Reset Commands (Use Sparingly)
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert a specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## Repository Purpose
This is your personal development playground for the Omarchy project. It's designed for:
- Rapid prototyping
- Quick iterations
- Personal experimentation
- Immediate deployment testing
- Learning and development

**Remember**: This is YOUR space. Break things, fix them, commit often, and keep moving forward. The goal is progress, not perfection.
